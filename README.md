### üßê Why Gatsby?

1.  **Fast, fast, & super fast**

    I wanted to use Gatsby because it is incredibly [fast](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-09-13-why-is-gatsby-so-fast/).

    
    This is due to a few reasons: 
    * Inlined critical CSS
    * Code splitting
    * Prefetch of soon-to-be-needed resources
    * Automatic optimizations


2.  **Familiar <img alt="React" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/1024px-React-icon.svg.png" width="25" />**

    I used React for my last project and wanted to use a familiar framework.
    By doing this, I was able to split different sections of the portfolio sites into separate components.


3.  **Gatsby Emotion <img alt="Emotion" src="https://emotion.sh/static/a76dfa0d18a0536af9e917cdb8f873b9/ae35a/emotion.png" width="25" />**

    While working on my portfolio I decided to use [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), a CSS-in-JS library, to build out the site.


    I had used a previous version in my last [project](https://mentalnote.herokuapp.com/) and it made it easy to fully separate components and UI without the concern of CSS from one component interfering with CSS from a different component. By using Emotion, the CSS for every component created is locally scoped.
